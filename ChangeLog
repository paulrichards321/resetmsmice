v.9 first public release
v.9.1 Thanks to Tony Houghton, fixed a segfault issue from a missing va_end and va_start. Included test functionality for the 6000 series mice.
v.9.2 Fixed resetmsmice-enable-boot.sh to look in /usr/local/sbin for resetmsmice. Also fixed a automake/autoconfig problem where resetmsmice-enable-boot was not being called in the right directory.
v.9.3 The code for the 6000 series mice does not work as expected. Will do further debugging of this once I get my hands on this model. Included message in program and in README that more debugging is needed for this model. Fixed an issue where LOG_DEBUG was too low of a priority on Centos and Fedora to get written to the syslog. Logging is now set to LOG_NOTICE.
v1.0.0 Using Alan Ott's hidapi for set feature and get feature usb code. This
code differs in that it performs a interrupt on the mouse before getting the
feature report. This seems to be needed to perform the correct connection with
the mouse. Hopefully this will now work with different models. In the enable
boot script, for systemd now call systemctl enable resetmsmice.service to
enable boot script.
v1.0.1 Large code creations and rewrites. Rewrote a lot of Alan Ott's code and merged it with main.c. Now scans the usb descriptors and checks for a usb mouse interface, and then reads the basic HID report and check to see if the smooth scroll feature is there before sending out any data to the mouse.
v1.0.2 We now check HID devices that could be a mouse, found a user who has a
Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 3000 and the subclass and interface
protocol values are 0.
v1.0.3 Enabled all warnings during compilation and found a couple of functions
not returning a value. Systemd config file is now stored in /lib/systemd/system,
where they should go. Added more notes to README.
v1.0.4 Was able to the Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500 and probably other mice working by using the current interface number as the wIndex parameter to libusb_control_transfer. 
v1.0.5 Thanks to Sverker Wiberg and Marc Altisent for sending in patches that fixed a segfault with certain models (At least the 1000 series).
v1.0.6 Further fixes to System V startup scripts. Tested on Centos 6.4 and Debian 7.1.
v1.1.0 Made resetmsmice able to run without admin rights. It now runs with set group id with the group only expanding to ms-usb, with the ms-usb group able to talk to usb Microsoft mice devices via udev. Simplified the init script installer, it now autodetects what type of init setup you have, ie system v, systemd, or upstart. Made a gui for the utility to setup and remove startup scripts and reset the mouse.
v1.1.1 Fixed resetmsmice-gui desktop icon on linux distributions that do not
have /usr/local/sbin or /usr/sbin in the default PATH. resetmsmice-gui and
resetmsmice have been moved to the bin folder. Included detection of
/usr/local or /usr for executables and ui file so conflicting installed
versions will not cause problems. The udev rules file location is autodetected
except for rpm installs where it is installed into /etc/udev/rules.d.
v1.1.2 Fixed debian package installation and removal scripts. dpkg-statoverride is called differently so it doesn't cause the scripts to exit prematurely if there is no override.
