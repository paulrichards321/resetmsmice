About this package
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This package, resetmsmice, fixes scroll wheel issues with certain Wireless Microsoft mice in X.org (includes KDE & Gnome applications), where the vertical wheel scrolls abnormally fast. Only needed if you dual boot between Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X or some linux distro.
Known to fix the vertical scroll wheel issue with the following models (and others related):
    Microsoft Wireless Mouse 1000
    Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 3000
    Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500
    Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 4000
    Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500
    Microsoft Wireless Mouse 5000
    Microsoft Sculpt Mouse
This program basically just resets a setting in the mouse through usb communications and then exits. 

Please let me know if this works for your mouse not listed above!!!
