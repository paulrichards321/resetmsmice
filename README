About this package
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This package, resetmsmice, fixes scroll wheel issues with certain Wireless Microsoft mice in X.org (includes KDE & Gnome applications), where the vertical wheel scrolls abnormally fast. Only needed if you dual boot between Microsoft Windows and some linux distro.
Known to fix the vertical scroll wheel issue with the following models (and others related):
    Microsoft Wireless Mouse 1000
    Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 3000
    Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500
    Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 4000
    Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500
    Microsoft Wireless Mouse 5000
    Microsoft Sculpt Mouse
This program basically just resets a setting in the mouse through usb communications and then exits. 

Please let me know if this works for your mouse not listed above!!!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Software requirements to compile 'resetmsmice':
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1) pkg-config
    In Ubuntu, Kubuntu, or Mint Linux this package is called: pkg-config
    You can get it through synaptic, or on the command line as root type this:
sudo apt-get install pkg-config

    In Fedora, and probably Centos and Redhat as well, as root, type this on the command line: 
yum install pkgconfig

    If you are on another distro and can't seem to find a package for pkgconfig, grab it here:
    http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config
    You will need to compile pkg-config and install it if your distro doesn't have a package.

 2) pthread runtime and development libraries
    Most linux boxes should have the runtime library already installed, the exception would be maybe some embedded devices that run a very stripped down kernel and distro. The pthread development headers and library are usually already in your distro's gcc/glibc development library packages.

 3) libusb-1.0 development files
    In Ubuntu, Kubuntu, or Mint Linux this package is called: libusb-1.0-0-dev
    You can get it through synaptic if you have it installed or on the command line:
sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev

    In Fedora, Centos, or Redhat, type the following as root:
yum install libusb1-devel

    If you can't seem to find this package in your distro's package manager,
    you can grab the tarball here:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb/files/libusb-1.0/

    I use libusb-1.0.8, but anything after that should work as well.

 4) gtk development files and associated dependencies
    In Ubuntu and other distros built on it,
sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
    In Fedora and probably Centos and Redhat as well, as root, type the follow as root:
yum install gtk2-devel

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling and installing this package:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open a command line, and cd into the directory you untarred this package then type:
./configure
make
make install

If configure or make error out, make sure you have the software requirements above.
The make install command will need to be run with the root account, in Ubuntu:
sudo make install

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To configure the system through the graphical interface after install
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have a Gnome, KDE, or Unity desktop, go to the Settings submenu and you will see an icon there for 'Microsoft Mouse Settings' for launching the program.

To launch it from the command line run:
resetmsmice-gui

From the graphical interface you can enable/disable the mouse to be reset on boot or reset right now. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To have the package run on system bootup on the command line
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By default the make install script sets up the package to run on boot, but if you disable it and ever need to enable it manually again run as root:
resetmsmice-enable-boot --enable

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To disable resetmsmice from starting on bootup on the command line
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
as root type: 
resetmsmice-enable-boot --disable

This will stop resetmsmice from running on bootup.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional linux kernel patch included
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you know how to compile your own kernel, I included a kernel patch for the 3.3.0 series kernel.
It is in this tarball in a directory: optional-kernel-patch/msresetmouse-3.3.0.patch
The userland program will be enough, but hopefully someday the patch will make it into the kernel after the userland program has tested the usb code enough!
