resetmsmice (1.1.2-1) precise; urgency=low
  * Fixed debian package installation and removal scripts. 
    dpkg-statoverride is called differently so it doesn't cause the scripts
    to exit prematurely if there is no override.

resetmsmice (1.1.1-1) precise; urgency=low
  * Fixed resetmsmice-gui desktop icon on linux distributions that do
    not have /usr/local/sbin or /usr/sbin in the default PATH. 
  * resetmsmice-gui and resetmsmice have been moved to the bin folder. 
  * Included detection of /usr/local or /usr for executables and ui file
    so conflicting installed versions will not cause problems.
  * The udev rules file location is autodetected except for rpm
    installs where it is installed into /etc/udev/rules.d.

resetmsmice (1.1.0-1) precise; urgency=low
  * Made resetmsmice able to run without admin rights. 
  * It now runs with set group id with the group only expanding to ms-usb,
    with the ms-usb group able to talk to usb Microsoft mice devices via udev. 
  * Simplified the init script installer, it now autodetects what type of
    init setup you have, ie system v, systemd, or upstart. 
  * Made a gui for the utility to setup and remove startup scripts and reset
    the mouse.

resetmsmice (1.0.5-1) wheezy; urgency=low

  * Initial debian package release. 
  * Thanks to Sverker Wiberg and Marc Altisent for sending in patches that fix: 
  * Fixed a segfault that occurred with certain models. 
  * Found a variable in parse.c that was not initialized.
  * Found a comparison in parse.c that was not accurate, needs >= not just =. 
  * Fixed sysv startup scripts on debian.

resetmsmice (1.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Ubuntu release.
  * Was able to the Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500 and probably other mice
    working.
  * by using the current interface number as the wIndex parameter to
    libusb_control_transfer.

resetmsmice (1.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Enabled all warnings during compilation and found a couple of functions
    not returning a value. Systemd config file is now stored in
    /lib/systemd/system, where they should go. Added more notes to README.

resetmsmice (1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * We now check HID devices that could be a mouse, found a user who has a
    Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 3000 and the subclass and interface
    protocol values are 0.

resetmsmice (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Large code creations and rewrites. Rewrote a lot of Alan Ott's code and
    merged it with main.c. Now scans the usb descriptors and checks for a usb
    mouse interface, and then reads the basic HID report and check to see if
    the smooth scroll feature is there before sending out any data to the mouse.

resetmsmice (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Using Alan Ott's hidapi for set feature and get feature usb code. This
    code differs in that it performs a interrupt on the mouse before getting
    the feature report. This seems to be needed to perform the correct
    connection with the mouse. Hopefully this will now work with different
    models. In the enable boot script, for systemd now call systemctl enable
    resetmsmice.service to enable boot script.

resetmsmice (0.9.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed problem with sys v init scripts not using prefix of 'S'. resetmsmice
    should now correctly startup on boot with sys v method.

resetmsmice (0.9.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The code for the 6000 series mice does not work as expected. Will do
    further debugging of this once I get my hands on this model. Included
    message in program and in README that more debugging is needed for this
    model. Fixed an issue where LOG_DEBUG was too low of a priority on Centos
    and Fedora to get written to the syslog. Logging is now set to LOG_NOTICE.

resetmsmice (0.9.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed resetmsmice-enable-boot.sh to look in /usr/local/sbin for
    resetmsmice. Also fixed a automake/autoconfig problem where
    resetmsmice-enable-boot was not being called in the right directory.
